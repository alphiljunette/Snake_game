This is a mini project that I recently made a few weeks ago, I named it "S'nake". I am in the process of learning JavaScript and I did it for practice. This mini project aims to create an online snake game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All players can play freely without logging in. Specifically, the player can change the color of his snake and the background of his playing field in the settings page according to his choice. Note, there is no backend in this game. I used the JavaScript DOM to store the scores in order to retrieve them later.To spice up the game a bit, I increased the snake's speed every 3 scores.
